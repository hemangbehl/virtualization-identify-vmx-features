
Try - 1 : [Failed - dual boot Ubuntu]
	copied the /boot/config_xyz file
	tried building the kernel using 'make && make install command'
	gave a few errors so we installed the required libraries
	ran the command again with 'sudo make -j 6' (as I have 6 processors in an i7) (sudo for explicit root access)
	this command ran for ~3 hours
	after restarting the Ubuntu OS, it showed kernel error
	essentially the kernel was corrupted :(
	Fortunately the windows OS wasn't affected
	

Try -2: [Success - VM Ware Workstation 15 on Win 10]
	Installed VM Ware workstation 15 on windows 10
	Gave the OS 8 GB of RAM and 40 GB HDD space
	cloned the github repo using got clone command to get the linux folder
	created a new folder 'cmpe283' and added the two files in that folder: Makefile and cmpe283-1.c
	run the command: 
		make
	some errors were shown so we installed the required libraries like flex, libdev, msr-tools etc using 'apt get-install'
	we run the 'make' command again
	.ko file is created
	we now try to insert this module into the kernel using
		insmod cmpe283-1.ko
	we see the list of messages (like module start/end) by running
		dmesg
	we now want to make more changes to the .C file so we remove the module by running
		rmmod cmpe283-1.ko
	we now run
		gedit cmpe283-1.c
	we edit the file as required
	and now run 'make' command again to build the ko file
		insmod cmpe283-1.ko
		dmesg
	we see the output showing the VMX capabilities as required.
	Output shows MSR address as 0x0
	On closer investigation, we see that MSR bits are not being read properly as the kernel doesn't not have access to read.
	For this, we enable 'nested VT-x capabilities' on VM Ware Workstation 15 (by editing the existing VM).
	Doing this fixes our problem and we are able to read the MSR properly.


Try -3:
	
	Installed VirtualBox on Mac OSX
	Guarantee the VM with 8 GB RAM and 16 GB Virtual Disk to contain linux repository
	Clone github repo and insert the original module source under '/cmpe283' with its Makefile
	Run the following command to compile the kernel module:

	## Compile Kernel module
	$ make
	
	## Insert the Kernel module into module folder and load it
	$ sudo ln -s cmpe283.ko /var/modules/$(uname -r)/
	$ sudo modprobe cmpe283
	
	## Check Kernel module is loaded
	$ lsmod | grep cmpe283
	
	## Check module loading info
	$ dmesg
	
	## Remove kernel module
	$ sudo modprobe -r cmpe283
	
	The dmesg outputs shows following information:
	[   41.784989] Run detect_vmx_features
	[   41.784992] True Controls mask is NOT supported!!!
	[   41.784994] Pinbased Controls MSR: 0x0
	...
	[   41.784999] Procbased Controls MSR: 0x0
	...
	[   41.785012] Exit Controls MSR: 0x0
	...
	[   41.785020] Entry Controls MSR: 0x0
	...
	
	Which indicates the vmx function is not supported in the VirtualBox VM instance.
	After investigate on virtualbox's manual and forum, we've known the information that VirtualBox seems only support nested VT-x on AMD CPUs, which is why we cannot get vmx features support on a VirtualBox.
